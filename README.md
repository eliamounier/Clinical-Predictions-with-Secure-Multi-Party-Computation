## üìò Overview
This project implements a **Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMC)** framework that enables multiple hospitals to jointly compute medical predictions **without sharing sensitive patient data**.  

We evaluate performance in terms of computation and communication cost, and demonstrate how the framework can support clinical decision-making (e.g., computing patient risk scores across distributed records).

## üß† Key Features
- Additive secret sharing in a finite field  
- Secure addition and multiplication (via Beaver triplets)  
- Performance analysis with up to 50 parties  
- Example application: privacy-preserving clinical risk scoring

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage
- Implemented in **Python 3.9**  
- Unit tests for secret sharing, arithmetic operations, and reconstruction  
- Performance benchmarks included
